# Coffee_Shop
This project is a mock API that a coffee shop UI app calls to get the costs of customer orders. 
The approach taken in this project is to use the Decorator Pattern to create objects for all possible drinks and addition combinations. 
This example contains only a few drink and addition options but the design is easily extendable to support new options. 

The Main function runs a test and outputs the test results along with the cost and the names of the test input drink orders.

The project targets .netcore 2.2 Sdk it's needed to run it.
